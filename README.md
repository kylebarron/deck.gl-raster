## Overview

[deck.gl](https://deck.gl) is a great geospatial rendering engine for the
browser. deck.gl layers are designed to be composable and easy to extend. As
such, small variations of the pre-built layers can do amazing new things, while
not being fit for inclusion in the standard layer library.

This repository contains deck.gl layers and reusable WebGL modules for rendering
and computation on rasters, especially satellite imagery.
